            A struggle for a lot of incoming students is just how large the
            campus truly is. They find it hard to find certain buildings and
            places to be, so they instead decide to just simply go home as they
            do not want to spend all that time walking around aimlessly. This
            causes a lot of the new students to miss out on a lot of fun
            activities, from FIUâ€™s various social events created by the many
            clubs on the campus, to simply going to eat at one of the many
            establishments with friends. Downloading the FIU app can also be a
            problem, as on top of many people not having the knowledge that this
            app even exists, it is hard to navigate and can often be
            overwhelming and off-putting. With a Discord bot, it can be
            significantly easier for students to find out information about the
            campus in real time. With commands such as !parking to tell you
            real-time information on the capacity of the parking garages,
            !events to help you see if there are any fun events happening on
            campus, and many more. Most students already have discord installed
            on their smartphones and desktop. This familiarity with the app
            makes the RoaryBot seem significantly less overwhelming and makes it
            easier for students to get to learn a lot more about the campus and
            its various activities.
